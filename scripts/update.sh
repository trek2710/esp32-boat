#!/usr/bin/env bash
# update.sh — one-shot "ship it" script for esp32-boat.
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. Rebuilds the sim firmware and refreshes binaries/*.bin so the
#      committed pre-built images always match the source.
#   2. Prepends a dated entry to CHANGELOG.md with the commit message.
#   3. Shows you what changed (git status + short diff stat).
#   4. Stages every change under tracked folders (src/, scripts/, binaries/,
#      hardware/, docs/, README.md, .gitignore, platformio.ini, include/,
#      CHANGELOG.md).
#   5. Commits with the message you pass in (or the DEFAULT_MSG below,
#      which Claude updates each time the repo changes).
#   6. Pushes to origin on the current branch.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/update.sh                          # use DEFAULT_MSG below
#   ./scripts/update.sh "custom commit message"  # override
#   ./scripts/update.sh -n                       # skip firmware rebuild
#   ./scripts/update.sh -n "docs-only tweak"     # skip build + custom msg
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 success    1 build failed    2 git failed    3 user aborted

# ============================================================================
# DEFAULT_MSG — the commit message for the current set of uncommitted
# changes. Claude updates this each time it modifies the repo, so you can
# just run `./scripts/update.sh` with no arguments and get a meaningful
# commit. Override by passing a message as the first positional argument.
# ============================================================================
DEFAULT_MSG="Display bring-up round 4: SPI side now clean — 64-byte sendPixels chunking, SPI3_HOST, and dropping spi_bus_free made runInitSequence/backlight-on/fillColor go through with no 'txdata transfer > hardware max supported len' errors on the panel. I2C side still blind: scan sees zero devices at 100 kHz with pins (SDA=11, SCL=10). That leaves pin-swap as the strongest remaining candidate — Waveshare has shipped multiple ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-2.1 revisions with SDA/SCL swapped. So Ui.cpp::begin() now tries the documented pin order first, scans; if zero devices, calls Wire.end() and re-inits with pins swapped, scans again. Whichever ordering ACKs devices is the one we keep. Also moved the scan out of Ch422g::begin() (now run once in Ui.cpp before the expander is touched) and dropped I2C to 100 kHz to tolerate the ESP32's weak internal pull-ups in case there are no board-level pull-ups."
