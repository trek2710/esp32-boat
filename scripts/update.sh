#!/usr/bin/env bash
# update.sh — one-shot "ship it" script for esp32-boat.
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. Rebuilds the sim firmware and refreshes binaries/*.bin so the
#      committed pre-built images always match the source.
#   2. Prepends a dated entry to CHANGELOG.md with the commit message.
#   3. Shows you what changed (git status + short diff stat).
#   4. Stages every change under tracked folders (src/, scripts/, binaries/,
#      hardware/, docs/, README.md, .gitignore, platformio.ini, include/,
#      CHANGELOG.md).
#   5. Commits with the message you pass in (or the DEFAULT_MSG below,
#      which Claude updates each time the repo changes).
#   6. Pushes to origin on the current branch.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/update.sh                          # use DEFAULT_MSG below
#   ./scripts/update.sh "custom commit message"  # override
#   ./scripts/update.sh -n                       # skip firmware rebuild
#   ./scripts/update.sh -n "docs-only tweak"     # skip build + custom msg
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 success    1 build failed    2 git failed    3 user aborted

# ============================================================================
# DEFAULT_MSG — the commit message for the current set of uncommitted
# changes. Claude updates this each time it modifies the repo, so you can
# just run `./scripts/update.sh` with no arguments and get a meaningful
# commit. Override by passing a message as the first positional argument.

DEFAULT_MSG="Display bring-up round 10: CHIPSET PIVOT. Round 9's exhaustive 420-pair I2C scan produced a clean result — only SDA=GPIO15 ever ACKs, and the only three addresses that respond are 0x15 (CST820 touch), 0x20 (TCA9554 I/O expander), and 0x51 (PCF85063 RTC). 0x24 and 0x38 — the CH422G MODE + WR_IO registers — never ACKed on any pin pair, meaning the board does NOT host a CH422G at all. That address signature (0x15 / 0x20 / 0x51) matches Waveshare's *other* 'ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-2.1' BOM: ST7701 RGB panel (NOT QSPI ST77916) + TCA9554 expander (NOT CH422G) + CST820 + PCF85063. Every one of our last 9 rounds has been building drivers for the wrong chipset family. This round does the minimum useful thing with that information: (1) lock I2C pins in display_pins.h to SDA=GPIO15 / SCL=GPIO7 (GPIO7 is Waveshare's silkscreen convention on the 4' sibling board; it gets verified at boot), (2) document the chipset pivot inline with a pivot plan (round 11 = swap ch422g.cpp for TCA9554; round 12+ = replace ST77916 QSPI driver with esp_lcd_panel_rgb ST7701 + PSRAM framebuffer), (3) add TCA9554 register/bit definitions (TCA9554_REG_CONFIG=0x03, TCA9554_REG_OUTPUT=0x01, bits IO0=LCD_BL / IO1=TP_RST / IO2=LCD_RST / IO3=SD_CS) alongside the existing CH422G ones — the CH422G symbols stay temporarily so ch422g.cpp still links, but are clearly marked UNUSED, (4) swap round 9's 420-pair exhaustive scan for a targeted round-10 diagnostic that fixes SDA=GPIO15 and runs the full 127-address scan on each SCL candidate in {7, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 16}. The correct SCL will produce exactly three ACKs (0x15 / 0x20 / 0x51); wrong SCLs will drop ACKs or produce spurious ones. Once round 10's serial log confirms SCL=GPIO7 gives the clean 3-hit set, round 11 can rip out ch422g.cpp and move on to the ST7701 RGB rewrite. No driver code changes this round — purely diagnostic + pivot documentation."
